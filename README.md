# Norman
A simple demo for CSV Normalization from scratch

This was created as a simple demonstration. Decisions were made to exhibit certain concepts, and ultimately act as a conversation point for furthering an interview process. I'd be happy to address any questions or concerns.

Unfortunely, due to my schedule and getting sick toward the end of this week, this is not to the state that I intended, but per the assignment instructions, I wanted to send this over in its current state.

Python was selected merely for its suitability for CLI applications.

## Install
`git clone git@github.com:JamesHesterJr/contax.git`

## Run
Syntax:
`python3 norman [input] [output]`

Example:
`python3 norman ./assignment/sample.csv output.csv`

## Run all tests
`python -m unittest discover`
